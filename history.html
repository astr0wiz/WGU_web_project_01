                    <h3>In the beginning...</h3>
                    <p>
                        Many years ago, before computers were commonplace (yes, there really was a time like that), the world was filled with uncertainty
                        and woe.  Famine ravaged the lands.  Floods inundated cities.  War scorched the earth, leaving nothing but death and disease in
                        its wake.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sages looked to the heavens for signs of change that they hoped would come.  Scholars scoured their libraries and archives, looking
                        in vain for a way to eradicate the horrors which plagued all of mankind.  World leaders wrung their hands as they were powerless
                        in the face of such devastating misery.  Yes, the times were very bad, and a lot of people were really mad.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then, on one magical spring morning, a hero was born.  Some call him Mankind's Hero, others speak of The Companion to All, a few call
                        him A Dumb Jerk, but real,<em>civilized</em>, normal people just call him plain ol' James.

                    <h3>Early life</h3>
                    <p>
                        Although scholars all agree James was born in a small town, none really know how dirt-poor his parents really were.

                    <p>Mrs. Mortenmauser, a neighbor to the family of James, penned the following in her private diary:</p>
                    <blockquote>May 22nd,<br/>Those pesky low lifes just dropped another one.  Oh, I can hear the child bawling and crying
                    all night long coming from the shed, I do.  Martha came to the house and she said the little 'un was a sweet as fresh drawn honey but 'e 
                    could throw a fit like the devil 'imself.  I think she has the right of it.  My Brucie went over there to 
                    see if there was anythin(sic) they needed, seeing as though they couldn't afford the dirt on their feet, 
                    but he stayed an awful long time and finally came back with a
                    grin like the cheshire cat, he did, and he kept telling me how beautiful the little brat was. I heard nothing
                    but bawling coming from that house.  I hope they leave soon.  I need to put the mower back into the shed.</blockquote>

                    <h3>League of Tremendous Bozos</h3>
                    <p>In his 18th year, according to tradition, James formed the League of Tremendous Bozos.  Originally a spoof of the Lambda Tau Beta
                    fraternity at Wassamatta U., James eventually transformed the group into a crime-fighting quartet.  The Canada-based group found
                    little to battle on earth and eventually turned their attentions toward space.</p>
                    <p>This, then, marked the dawn of James' ascendancy to near-godhood.  For it was during those times that galactic evil wet
                    its britches in sheer agony, unable to stop the League of Tremendous Bozos' quest for galactic peace.</p>

                    <h3>Recently...</h3>
                    <p>Following unmitigated success with the league, James settled down to a quiet life in the delta region of the USA.  He now lives 
                    with his wife, a pet computer, and several animals that follow him around the house as if he were Doctor Dolittle.</p>
