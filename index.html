                        Unlike the immortal being he may be, James often boasts that he was born from two members of <i>Homo Sapiens</i>: a mother and a father.
                        That is, the "mother" actually did the bearing, while the "father" did the...er...well, you know.

                    <p>
                        Throughout the ages, or perhaps more accurately, during the last five decades, philosophers have spent countless hours debating this very question.
                        Answers have come to naught, however, and so they've moved on to more important conundrums, leaving the sleepless browser (yes, that's you)
                        to continue where the they left off.

One of James' favorite pastimes involves the artistic
creation of several self-protraits, mainly abstract
in theme.  In 'The Lost Marbles', we are made witness
to his inquisitive mind, filled with spheres of
contained restlessness, glinting in the sunlight of
truth, and, yet, hovering in the darkness of realizations
both lost and imagined, while the world around him
seeks to limit his deeds from all four cardinal directions.

Or, perhaps, it's just another crazy painting.

                    <p>
                        Maintenance is not the issue here.  For, if you actually read James' history, then you would know that the above question makes the implication
                        he had been sane some time before.

                        Truly, when one has accomplished so much -- too much in fact for this humble web site to list -- what comes next?  The answer to that question
                        may come as a surprise.  Yes, James has a plan or two up his sleeve.
